# Does the code work? If not, what's broken. 

Yes. The code is currently working in someway, but with much less features.

# How is the code better than what the team currently has?

No. It is much worse than the team currently has.

# How is the code worse?

First, it can only achieve some basic frontend work, like the textbox and mapping feature.

Also, It does not have a database or any backend system, so nothing can be permently stored. Everything is in the frontend and are temperory.

It seems not really work well between multiple files. Coding in one huge file performs much better than coding between seperate files. But it still performs worse than human.

# How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

Probably 5 times. The main struggle is ChatGPT 3.5 is not able to build a useful working backend. So anything requires a server could never be done.

# Overall impression of the experience

My overall impression of the experience is okay. Even though ChatGPT 3.5 doesn't really fulfill my requirement, it still works in coding simple frontend and css styling, which is the most boring and redundent work. So, rather to give ChatGPT a brunch of difficult work or the entire work, I'll suggest to let it do some simple but boring, meaningless work.
