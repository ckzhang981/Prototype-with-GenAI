# Briefly describe what the code is supposed to do.

The correct behavior is for the code to define a React component called `FlashSwarm' for managing and logging swarms. It includes a form for users to enter the time and location of the swarm. Upon submission, it records the swarm details and can send a notification via an API. The component also maintains and displays a list of swarm logs that includes the time and location of each swarm. The notification status is temporarily displayed to the user when a notification is successfully sent.

# Does the code work? If not, what's broken. 

Yes. The code is currently working in someway, but with much less features.
However, these is something not work, like the sending email feature. It will cause error since there is not database or any sort of server, but it won't result the code crush.

# How is the code better than what the team currently has?

No. It is much worse than the team currently has.

# How is the code worse?

First, it can only achieve some basic frontend work, like the textbox and mapping feature.

Also, It does not have a database or any backend system, so nothing can be permently stored. Everything is in the frontend and are temperory, resulting the inability of the sending email feature to work.

Moreover, even though the code can send email to notify the user, it is not able to receive user's replied message and record it.

It seems not really work well between multiple files. Coding in one huge file performs much better than coding between seperate files. But it still performs worse than human.

# How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?

Probably 5 times. The main struggle is ChatGPT 3.5 is not able to build a useful working backend. So anything requires a server could never be done.

# Overall impression of the experience

My overall impression of the experience is okay. Even though ChatGPT 3.5 doesn't really fulfill my requirement, it still works in coding simple frontend and css styling, which is the most boring and redundent work. So, rather to give ChatGPT a brunch of difficult work or the entire work, I'll suggest to let it do some simple but boring, meaningless work.
